Abstract:
The dataset provided for the heart disease prediction project is a valuable resource for building a robust 
predictive model. It contains a diverse set of attributes related to individuals' health and lifestyle, 
making it conducive for comprehensive analysis. Here's an extract highlighting key aspects of the 
dataset:
The dataset comprises several columns, each representing a specific attribute or characteristic related to 
the individuals under study. These attributes include:
1. Heart Disease: This binary classification target variable indicates whether an individual has been 
diagnosed with heart disease or not. It serves as the primary outcome variable for our prediction model.
2. BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of an individual's body fat based on height and weight. It 
provides insights into an individual's overall health and can be a significant predictor of heart disease 
risk.
3. Smoking: This binary variable indicates whether an individual is a smoker or not. Smoking is a wellestablished risk factor for heart disease.
4. Alcohol Drinking: Similar to smoking, alcohol consumption can impact heart health. This variable 
denotes whether an individual drinks alcohol regularly.
5. Stroke, Physical Health, Mental Health, DiffWalking: These attributes provide information about an 
individual's overall health and well-being, which can be associated with heart disease risk.
6. Sex and Age Category: Demographic variables like gender and age are crucial factors in heart disease 
risk assessment. Age, in particular, is a significant risk factor.
7. Race: The race or ethnicity of the individuals can be relevant as heart disease prevalence can vary 
among different racial groups.
8. Diabetic, Physical Activity, GenHealth, Sleep Time, Asthma, Kidney Disease, Skin Cancer: These 
variables encompass various aspects of an individual's medical history, lifestyle, and health conditions, 
all of which can contribute to the prediction of heart disease risk.
The dataset is diverse, containing both categorical and continuous variables, allowing for a multifaceted 
analysis. By exploring and preprocessing this dataset, we can develop a predictive model that takes into 
account a wide range of factors to accurately classify individuals' heart disease risk. This dataset's 
richness makes it a valuable asset for our project, enabling us to contribute to early heart disease 
detection and prevention
